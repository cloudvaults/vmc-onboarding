  How to troubleshoot HCX for VMware Cloud on AWS 
---

## Introduction

## What is VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX)?

VMware HCX®, an application mobility platform, simplifies application migration, workload rebalancing and business continuity across data centers and clouds. HCX enables high-performance, large-scale app mobility across VMware vSphere® and non-vSphere cloud and on-premises environments to accelerate data center modernization and cloud transformation. HCX automates the creation of an optimized network interconnect and extension, and facilitates interoperability across KVM, Hyper-V and vSphere 5.0+ to current vSphere versions. This delivers live and bulk migration capabilities without redesigning the application or re-architecting networks.
